A common mistake is to use & as the main connective
Results in a blanket statement about everything
For example, don’t say:
x human(x) & mammal(x)
 which would be:
		(human(Rodgers) & mammal(Rodgers))& 	(human(Cutler) & mammal(Cutler)) & 	(human(LambeauField) & mammal(LambeauField)) & …
But this means everything is human and a mammal!

Deciding how to map an English sentence into logic can be tricky, especially with universals.  A common mistake is to use conjunction as the main connective (instead of using implication which is usually the correct way.)

If we mistranslate “All humans are mammals” as “For all x human(x) and mammal (x), what we get is equivalent to a conjunction of conjunctions. If we translate back to English, then what we have said is “Everything is both a human and a mammal”  (which would include my_house, my_shoes, my_street) which is false.
