Abstract individuals are entities that we introduce to make reasoning simpler in the future.
This idea is called reification.
A typical example is when dealing with the representation of events, for which we may have varying amounts of information to describe them. 
Since predicates must have a fixed arity, we will introduce new objects to reduce n-ary predicates to 1 place predicates and functions.

The first issue, related to arity is addressed by something called abstract individuals.

Abstract individuals are those that are not present in the original problem (that is not your typical person, place, or thing) but instead are added to address problems in reasoning.

The idea of making up new individuals is called reification. Things we typically make up are events and moments or durations of time.

When we reify something we usually reduce an n-ary predicate with single place predicates and functions.
