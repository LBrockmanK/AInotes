A free variable is a variable that isn’t bound by a quantifier
 i.e. $y Likes(x,y):  x is free, y is bound

A well-formed formula is a sentence where all variables are quantified (none are free)

In the examples that we have seen, every variable that we have seen has been bound by a quantifier. This is required.

A so-called free variable is one that is not bound by a quantifier. But if a variable is free, then we have no way to determine the meaning of the sentence.

A well-formed formula (WFF, or “woof”) is a sentence where all the variables are quantified.
