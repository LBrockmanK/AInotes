A sentence is valid if it is true in all models:
P1 P1	 	P1P1 	(tautologies)

A sentence is satisfiable if it is true in some models, or interpretations:
P1 P2

A sentence is unsatisfiable if it is true in no models:
P1 P1		(inconsistent/contradiction)
24

Some sentences are always true, no matter what truth assignment we consider for the sentences. We call these valid sentences.  P or not P is an example.

Some sentences are sometimes true. We call these satisfiable.

Some sentences are never true. We call these unsatisfiable. We can also call them inconsistent or contradictory.
