Summary of Benefits of KBSBy explicitly representing knowledge, we can:
reuse knowledge to solve different tasks.
Returning a list of all white things, or painting pictures
extend existing behavior by adding new knowledge.
E.g. Canaries are yellow.
debug faulty behavior by locating erroneous beliefs.
E..g. “No the sky is not yellow. It is blue.”
explain and justify behavior of the system
E.g. “because grass is a form of vegetation
Explicit representations of knowledge give KR system many advantages over traditional procedural programs.

First, the knowledge is reusable. The same facts could be used to solve several different tasks.
Second, the knowledge is extendable. We can add new facts and the behavior will adapt immediately.
Third, we can look at the encoded facts and use them to debug faulty behavior.
Fourth, we can use the facts to explain and justify the behavior of the system.  
This is especially important for medical applications.
