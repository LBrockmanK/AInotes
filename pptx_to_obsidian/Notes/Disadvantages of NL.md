Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope"
Context dependency
"John met Sam.  HeJohn gave himSam a shove."
(Apparent) non-compositionality
"John kissed Mary." vs "John kissed [all the girls].“
Kiss(John, Mary) vs  x Forall x. girl(x) →  kiss(john,x)


The third fatal flaw for automated reasoning would be that NL appears to be non-compositional
What this means is that similar sentences might have very different representations and it wasn’t clear to logicians how to relate the two.
While this is a complaint, this non-compositionality can be addressed if one uses another construct from 
Mathematics, called the lambda calculus.
