Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope"
Context dependency
"John met Sam.  He gave him a shove."


A second big flaw from a reasoning point of view is the context dependency of NL.
For people this is good, because we can use fewer words to express things. 
But who are the referents for these pronouns?

Really, either reading would work. 
But without actually seeing the assault, or knowing anything about their tendencies to violence,  
we might assume that He refers to John and Him refers to Sam, 
because it uses the same subject and object as the previous sentence.
