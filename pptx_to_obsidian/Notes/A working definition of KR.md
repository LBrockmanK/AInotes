Knowledge representation and reasoning is an area of AI that is concerned with how to use symbols to represent "a domain of discourse", along with functions that allow inference about the objects within the domain of discourse to occur. 
Adapted from the Wikipedia Article on KRR

A domain of discourse constitutes the entities in  a problem under consideration, including the objects,  their properties and capabilities, and any known facts about entities, events or states of the environment.
Inference is a procedure by which we can determine the truth of facts we have not been told explicitly (ie the implicitly known ones).

We will start with a definition that I adapted from the Wikipedia entry. The wiki is actually pretty good so I encourage you to read  the whole thing.

The essence of the definition is that knowledge representation and reasoning involves the use of symbols to represent some domain of discourse and the use of procedures that implement inference about the objects within the domain

A domain of discourse, or conceptualization, is simply the entities that comprise a problem including the objects, their properties and capabilities, and any explicitly known facts about them.

Inference  is a procedure to determine the truth of facts that are not explicit in the representation.
