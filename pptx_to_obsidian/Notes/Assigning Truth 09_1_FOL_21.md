To determine the truth of any atomic sentence we look to see if the objects referred to by the terms of the sentences are in the relation referred to be the predicate of the sentence.

So we can ask about the truth value of “holding(J, cash1)”.

Since <J, cash1> is in the holding relation the sentence is true.
