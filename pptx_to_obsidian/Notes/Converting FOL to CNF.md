6. Drop universal quantifiers:
All variables are only universally quantified after step 5
e.g. xP(x)yQ(y) becomes P(x)Q(y)
All variables in KB will be assumed to be universally quantified

7. Distribute  over  :
	(PQ)R becomes (PR)(QR)

8. Group conjunctions/disjunctions together:
	(PQ)R becomes (PQR)
	(PQ)R becomes (PQR)
