Abduction

Analogical

These reasoning methods that are not deductive and the reasoning is not always sound, but they provide a way of dealing with  incomplete or uncertain information.

To better model some of the reasoning that people do,  researchers have developed several non-deductive approaches to reasoning.
For example, abduction is based on a rule, similar to modus ponens that says, if you have a rule “if A then B”
And you observe B then you may abduce that A is true.  This is the sort of reasoning we do when diagnosing the cause based on a symptom. However the conclusions won’t always be valid: Not every cough is pneumonia.
