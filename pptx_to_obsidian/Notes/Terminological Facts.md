These are general relationships among predicates, such as:
disjointness  x[Cat(x)  ¬Dog(x)]
subtype  x[Human(x)  Mammal(x)]
exhaustive  x[Being(x)  Alive(x)V Dead(x)
symmetry x y [Sibling(x,y)   Sibling(y,x)]
inverses  x  y [ChildOf(x,y)  ParentOf(y,x)]
type restrictions  x  y [MarriedTo(x,y)  
      Person(x)  Person(y)   x ≠ y ]
They are usually universally quantified conditionals or biconditionals
