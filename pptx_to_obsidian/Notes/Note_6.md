 FormulasAn atomic sentence is the smallest expression to which a truth value can be assigned
Predicate(term1, â€¦, termn):
e.g. teacher(McRoy,You), lte(sqrt(2),sqrt(7))
Maps one or more objects to a truth value
Represents a user defined relation
Term1 = Term2:
e.g. height(McRoy) = 66,  1 = 2
Represents when two terms refer to the same object
An atomic sentence is the smallest expression to which a truth value may be assigned.
There are two types of atomic sentences: 
	one is a predicate symbol with zero or more terms as arguments. (A predicate symbol with zero argument is the same as in propositional logic.) These sentences represent user defined relations. To be meaningful, each such symbol needs a definition called an interpretation which says which tuples are in the relation (like documentation) .
	Another type of sentence is a sentence that asserts the equality of two terms. It is used to represent the relation when two terms refer to the same object.
