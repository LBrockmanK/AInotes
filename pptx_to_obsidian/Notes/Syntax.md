The syntax of a logic tells you the well-formed sequences of symbols
FOL has 2 types of symbols:
Logical symbols have a fixed meaning in the language. There are 3 types:
Punctuation (such as parentheses)
Connectives and quantifiers
Variables  (x, y, z, x1, x2, …)
Non-logical symbols are those whose meanings depend on the application  (there are an infinite supply of these)
Function symbols (bestFriend, a, b, c, d,…, h)
Predicate symbols (OlderThan, P, Q, R, P1,…)
