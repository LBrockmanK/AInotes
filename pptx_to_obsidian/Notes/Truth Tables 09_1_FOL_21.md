Truth tables are a method for enumerating possible models of sentences.

Each row of the table shows a different possible truth assignment; the number of rows will be determined by the number of propositional symbols, because for each symbol there are 2 possible assignments.

The columns after the first two are determined by the rules for the operators, given the interpretation of the propositional symbols.
