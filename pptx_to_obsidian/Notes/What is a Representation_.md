Representation is a relationship between two domains, where the first is meant to stand for the second.
The represented domain  is something “real”, e.g. the environment, of which an agent will have only limited access, such as through its sensors.
The representor domain  uses symbols, which are more accessible than the represented domain
Numerals  represent  numbers
Names   represent objects
Sentences  represent  propositions
The mapping from the representor to the represented is the semantics of the representation
