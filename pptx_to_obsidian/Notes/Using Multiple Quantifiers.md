Properties of quantifiers:
x y is the same as y x
x y is the same as y x

Why?
 "x "y likes(x,y) the active voice: “Everyone likes everyone.”
 "y "x likes(x,y) the passive voice: “Everyone is liked by everyone.”

These next few slides contain several interesting properties of quantifiers and their orderings.  I will mention these things briefly, but you should take a minute before moving on.

First, when you have two nested quantifiers that are the same, it doesn’t matter what order they come in. (It is like you are picking two elements from a set but immediately putting the first element back before you pick the second one, so there is no dependence between the two.)

In English this is like saying “Everyone likes everybody” is the same as “Everyone is liked by everybody”.
Properties of quantifiers:
x y is not the same as y x
x y is not the same as y x

Why?
x y likes(x,y) “Everyone has someone they like.”
y x likes(x,y)  “There is someone who is liked by everyone.”

However, when the quantifiers are different then the order is VERY important.

So to express “Everyone has someone that they like” we use for all x, there exists y. which means that each x can have a different y that they like. (Or they can like the same y; there is no restriction).

However to express “There is someone who is liked by everyone”, we have to put the existential on the outside (exists x for_all y likes(x,y)) .
Properties of quantifiers:
x P(x) is the same as x P(x)
x P(x) is the same as x P(x)

Why?
x sleep(x)“Everybody sleeps.”
x  sleep(x)double negative: “Nobody doesn’t sleep.”

Another interesting property is that we can rewrite each of the quantifiers in terms of the other one. You just negate both the new quantifier and the sentence inside the expression.

This is akin to saying that we can reduce a double negation.

For example in English, “everybody sleeps” means the same as “nobody doesn’t sleep.”
