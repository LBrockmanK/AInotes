A term is used to denote an object in the world
Variables:   x, y, z, …
Function(term1, …, termn):
Constants: (functions of arity 0): Max …
e.g. sqrt(9), distance(Milwaukee,x)
Use functions to express names or to refer to an unnamed object: e.g. leftLegOf(John)
A ground term is a term with no variables

In first order logic we use terms to denote objects in the world.  
We have variables, which we must define (typically a finite set of lower case letters). 
Also, given a sequence of n terms and a function symbol of arity n, f of term 1 to term n will also be a term.
	A special case will be the constants, which are functions of arity 0.
	More generally functions will have more than one argument.
	Use a function to express a name or to refer to an unnamed object. (Note that expressions may look like relations. We can tell them apart by using a separate set of symbols (which we specify like the variables) and also by looking at where they appear. If they appear as an argument of a relation symbol then they are expressions. 

A ground term (or a ground anything) is an expression without any variables, that is, all the terms are constants.
