Properties of quantifiers:
x P(x) is the same as x P(x)
x P(x) is the same as x P(x)

Why?
x sleep(x)“Everybody sleeps.”
x  sleep(x)double negative: “Nobody doesn’t sleep.”

Another interesting property is that we can rewrite each of the quantifiers in terms of the other one. You just negate both the new quantifier and the sentence inside the expression.

This is akin to saying that we can reduce a double negation.

For example in English, “everybody sleeps” means the same as “nobody doesn’t sleep.”
