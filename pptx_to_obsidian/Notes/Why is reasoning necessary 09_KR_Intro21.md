We want our knowledge (and not just our explicitly encoded facts) to affect action
Example:
“Alice is allergic to medication m.”
“Anybody allergic to medication m is also allergic to m'.”
Is it OK to prescribe m' for Alice ?

Reasoning is going to be time consuming. A fair question is Why do we need reasoning?
And, the reason is that in most cases we will not be able to represent all our knowledge explicitly but
Instead will need to have some general rules that we can apply to new entities as they arise.
Consider this example: 

we may never have met Alice before, but we clearly want to put our facts together here
And not give her medication m-prime.
