There are many formalisms for KR, nearly all based on some logic, because logics are very expressive and the semantics and reasoning systems for them are well-defined 
Approaches will vary significantly in how easy it is to say things and how long it takes, in real-time, to make the inferences that are needed by an application.
More expressive languages tend to allow us to say things more compactly, but reasoning with them take much longer.. 

The key problem is to thus to  find a KR approach that can make the inferences an application needs in time that is within the resource constraints of the problem at hand
