﻿	First, what do we mean by knowledge.
﻿	Knowledge is a mental state, one of many, that holds of an agent and some statement (called a proposition).

Knowing, hoping, thinking, remembering: these are all examples of mental states. Our language is rich with them.
Formally, we call the relationships “propositional attitudes” and they appear as verbs in our language.
One special case is believing. Believing seems to express a judgment of an agent about the truth of some statement.
Belief is also somewhat special, because we assume that the agent is aware of his belief, that is that he would
Believe that he believes it is raining, and so on. For now we will keep it simple though.

The key idea we will keep in mind is that of the agent who is having the mental attitude toward something.
Knowledge is like belief, except that there is an implied reference to the world outside the agent.
Thus, we sometimes say that knowledge is true belief.

To capture this distinction completely we might need different models, each with their own mapping to truth values (called an interpretation).

Okay, so now we can consider the second question, what is representation.
**
Representation is a link between two domains, such that the first is meant to stand for the second.
**
Since we might have multiple layers of representation, lets keep it simple and think of the second one, the represented domain, as the real world.
The real world is not entirely accessible to an agent, who is limited to the percepts that he receives from his sensors.
In people that would be eyes, ears, nose, etc.
In computers it would might be only the ability to read characters from a file or keyboard buffer.
**
The representor domain then uses symbols, each corresponding to the objects in its domain that it has access to.
For example, it uses numerals to represent numbers or quantities. 
It uses names to represent objects
It uses sentences in some language to represent propositions.
**
The mapping from representor to represented corresponds to the semantics of the representation.
Whem the mapping is part of the real world, to access the semantics in a machine, we would need to represent this mapping, that we willl call the interpretation.
