Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope"
Context dependency
"John met Sam.  HeJohn gave himSam a shove."
(Apparent) non-compositionality
"John kissed Mary." vs "John kissed [all the girls].“
Kiss(John, Mary) vs  x Forall x. girl(x) →  kiss(john,x)


The third fatal flaw for automated reasoning would be that NL appears to be non-compositional
What this means is that similar sentences might have very different representations and it wasn’t clear to logicians how to relate the two.
While this is a complaint, this non-compositionality can be addressed if one uses another construct from 
Mathematics, called the lambda calculus.
We want our knowledge (and not just our explicitly encoded facts) to affect action
Example:
“Alice is allergic to medication m.”
“Anybody allergic to medication m is also allergic to m'.”
Is it OK to prescribe m' for Alice ?

Reasoning is going to be time consuming. A fair question is Why do we need reasoning?
And, the reason is that in most cases we will not be able to represent all our knowledge explicitly but
Instead will need to have some general rules that we can apply to new entities as they arise.
Consider this example: 

we may never have met Alice before, but we clearly want to put our facts together here
And not give her medication m-prime.
