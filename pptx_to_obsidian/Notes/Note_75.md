The key challenge of KRThere are many formalisms for KR, nearly all based on some logic, because logics are very expressive and the semantics and reasoning systems for them are well-defined 
Approaches will vary significantly in how easy it is to say things and how long it takes, in real-time, to make the inferences that are needed by an application.
More expressive languages tend to allow us to say things more compactly, but reasoning with them take much longer.. 

The key problem is to thus to  find a KR approach that can make the inferences an application needs in time that is within the resource constraints of the problem at hand
 
When we talk about symbols, most of the time we will be talking about them as part of a logic.
Logics are expressive, have well-defined semantics, and support reasoning.
There are several variations of logic because in its full-expressiveness, logic is undecidable.
Different logics make it easier or harder to say things, and make it easier or harder to do automated reasoning.
Part of what you want to learn is how to select a logic and reasoner that is just powerful enough to do what is needed in time that meets the resource constraints of the problem
