A common mistake is to use & as the main connective
Results in a blanket statement about everything
For example, don’t say:
x human(x) & mammal(x)
 which would be:
		(human(Rodgers) & mammal(Rodgers))& 	(human(Cutler) & mammal(Cutler)) & 	(human(LambeauField) & mammal(LambeauField)) & …
But this means everything is human and a mammal!
