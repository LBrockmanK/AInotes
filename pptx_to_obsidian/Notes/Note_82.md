Disadvantages of using NL
Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw the man on the hill with the telescope"

First, NL is notoriously amibiguious.
The words are ambiguous, so bat can be a baseball thing or a furry flying mammal thing.
Also the grammars are ambiguous, leading to sentences that cannot be interpreted without more information.
This example is pretty well known in linguistics because of all the ways we might group the prepositional phrases.
