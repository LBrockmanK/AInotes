Deduction as forward chaining adds all sentences that can be inferred â€“ it is both sound and complete (but slow) & has been used for some databases.
Deduction as backward chaining starts with a goal and tries to search backward, trying to prove the premises of rules as subgoals; it is faster but incomplete.
Resolution is an alternative strategy where the negation of a goal is added to (a CNF version of) a KB and then to prove the KB+ is unsatisfiable we find & remove complementary literals, one at a time.
