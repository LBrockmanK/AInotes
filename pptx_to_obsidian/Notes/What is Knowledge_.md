Consider the relationships between a knower and a proposition that we can express in language:
John knows it is raining.
John hopes it is raining.
John thinks it may be raining.
These relationships are called propositional attitudes, and are usually indicated by the verb when the agent is mentioned explicitly.
Beliefs correspond to a judgment by an agent about the state of the world.
John believes it is raining
