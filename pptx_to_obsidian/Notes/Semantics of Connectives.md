The domain will allow us to compute the  truth value for each proposition:
e.g. P1= true,  P2= false
We also use models to interpret expressions of equality, ex f(a) = f(b) iff I(f(a)) and I(f(b)) are the same in the model.
To define connectives, we have rules for evaluating truth with respect to some model m:
S		is true  iff S	is false
S1S2	is true  iff S1	is true	and	S2 is true
S1S2	is true  iff S1	is true	  or	S2 is true
S1S2 	is true  iff S1 is false      or	S2 is true		is false iff S1 is true	and	S2 is false
S1S2 	is true iff S1S2 	is true 	and 	S2S1 is true

Operator Precedence: (highest)      (lowest)
