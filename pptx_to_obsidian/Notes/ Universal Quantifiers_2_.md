x human(x)  mammal(x)

Equivalent to the conjunction of all the instantiations of variable x:
	(human(Rodgers)  mammal(Rodgers)) &(human(Cutler)  mammal(Cutler)) & (human(…)  mammal(…)) & …

Another way of thinking about universally quantified sentences is to replace the variable with all the ground terms that  it can refer to.

So a sentence like “all humans are mammals” is equivalent to a conjunction of all the sentences “If Rodgers is Human then Rodgers is a mammal” and so on,
 for all possible instantiations of the variables.

Note that not all possible instantiations will be useful. For example, “If MyHouse is human then MyHouse is a mammal” is a true sentence even if both of the embedded atomic propositions are false.

Also, if a conceptualization includes function symbols, then this will be an infinite conjunction, which is why we wouldn’t represent it this way in the first place. (Or we might just say “No functions”.)
