In FOL, sentences  can be negated, conjoined and disjoined.  We use the right arrow to indicate “implication”, which we read as if S1 then S2 and a double arrow for “equivalence” among sentences, which we read as S1 if and only if S2.
Once we have a KB of facts, when we can use it to answer questions. 
A proof is simply a sequence of FOL sentences that proceeds from what is known to be true until a suitable conclusion is reached.
We will address this together, when we consider inference in FOL.

What do we do with all these facts?  Well a KB is not very useful on its own.  We will rely on some sort of reasoning procedure to allow us to answer questions that are not explicit in the representation.

A proof is just that: it is a sequence of logical sentences that proceeds from what is known to be true until a suitable conclusion is reached. The solution will tell us whether something is true, and it can also tell us for which individual the answer would be true.

In the meantime, we will consider two issues not addressed so far: what to do when it seems like a predicate does not have a fixed arity and what we can do in FOL to describe measurable quantities.
