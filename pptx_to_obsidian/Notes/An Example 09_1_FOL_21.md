Lets consider an example.  First we decide on a set of objects and relations that we think are relevant to describing some situation.

Here, the objects comprise  two people, named R and J, a crown, a sword, a bag of cash, and two legs. To name the stuff, we may invent symbols such as sword1, or we might use a function like swordOf(R).

The relations are shown as labels on ovals or on links between ovals.  For each relation, there is a set of tuples that are in the relation.
For example,
   On_head contains {<crown1,R>}
   Brother contains {<R,J>, <J,R>}
   Person contains {<R>, <J>}
   King contains {<J>}
