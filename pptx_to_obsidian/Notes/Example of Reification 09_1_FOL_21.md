Events, which are represented by verbs in human languages, are one common use of abstract individuals.

For example, we might express the idea of John purchased a bike differently, depending on how much we know. We don’t really want to use a different predicate for each case, because the underlying transaction is the same. 

So, we add an abstract purchase event, here “p” and use it to state everything in terms of unary functions and the equality predicate.

Another good use is when a predicate depends on a sequence of events.
