Deductive reasoningThe heart of deductive reasoning is the sequential application of rules of inference such as modus ponens:
From A -> B and A  infer  B
Deduction is good because it is sound (which means only logically entailed sentences can be inferred), but it isn’t always the best match for human reasoning


The most common form of reasoning is deduction. Deduction involves the sequential application of rules of inference.
Deduction is easy to automate and provides correct results.
Its limitations are that it isn’t always the best model of human reasoning, which may involve uncertain information.
