An interpretation will assign each formula a truth value.

When a formula receives the value true we say that it is satisfied.

For a set of sentences we only say that an interpretation satisfies the set if it satisfies all the members of the set.\
When an interpretation satisfies a set  we say that it is a logical model of the set.

*
Some sentences are always true, no matter what truth assignment we consider for the sentences. We call these valid sentences.  P or not P is an example.

Some sentences are sometimes true. We call these satisfiable.

Some sentences are never true. We call these unsatisfiable. We can also call them inconsistent or contradictory.
