Disadvantages of using NLSyntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope"
Context dependency
"John met Sam.  He gave him a shove."

A second big flaw from a reasoning point of view is the context dependency of NL.
For people this is good, because we can use fewer words to express things. 
But who are the referents for these pronouns?
