Formulas
Atomic Sentence: Smallest expression with a truth value
e.g. Predicate(term1, …, termn), term1 = term2 
Sentence: An atom, quantified sentence with variables, or complex sentence using connectives; assigned a truth value
Well-Formed Formula (wff): A sentence where all variables are quantified
We also defined the legal expressions of the language including the terms and the well-formed formulas.

Note that a sentence that has a variable that is not bound by a quantifier (known as a free variable) is not well-formed and would not have a truth assignment.
