Given the domain and an interpretation mapping for all symbols,we can get the denotation of each ground term in FOL compositionally:
		Suppose   |bestFriend| = f, |Max| = max1
                  Then |bestFriend(Max)| = f(max1)
   
To interpret terms with variables, we will also need to have a variable assignment, which is a mapping from the variables to the elements in the domain.

Given the domain and an interpretation mapping, we can specify which elements of the domain denoted by any variable free (ground) term of FOL.
For example, to interpret bestFriend(Max)  we use the mapping to the function denoted by “bestFriend” and then apply that function to the element denoted by “Max”.
To interpret terms with variables, we will also need to have a variable assignment, which is a mapping from the variables to the elements in the domain.
