First-Order logic is a language that is very expressive, but inference is challenging.
The Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining algorithms use Generalized Modus Ponens (but are only complete for HNF).
Resolution inference is complete for all FOL (even if not HNF) but KBs must be converted to CNF to use it.



To summarize, FOL is expressive, but inference is sometimes difficult to automate
