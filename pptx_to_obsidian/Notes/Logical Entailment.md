A set of sentences S logically entails a proposition p when the truth of p is implicit in the sentences of S
If the world is such that S is true (each proposition in S is true), then it must be case that p is also true.
Logic is the  study of entailment relations
To define a logic we define the syntax of the language (well-formedness)
The truth conditions for well-formed expressions
The rules of inference (that preserve entailment)

Earlier I said that we want reasoning because we want to know when: one set of facts constrains the world such that another fact just has to be true.

This is the essence of something called logical entailment.

In this description, we talk about a set of sentences S (which we will assume is true) and a sentence p,
Which must be true whenever every sentence in S is true.

How do we know when S constrains p in this way?  Well that is what a logic does: it  provides a set of entailment
Relations and also some procedures that preserve entailment.

We start by defining the well-formed sentences of the language. That is the synttax.
Then, for each well formed expression, we provide truth conditions. 
Then, we specify the rules of inference that preserve entailment. 
We want to choose rules that will be efficient to process and give us all  of what we need (which might be a subset of
What is actually entailed).
To verify that entailments are preserved, we  can check each rule by looking at the truth conditions of conclusions, given all possible interpretations  of the premises. 
However once an inference rule is trusted, such as modus ponens, we don’t need to validate it again.
