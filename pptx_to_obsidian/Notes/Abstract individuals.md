Abstract individuals are entities that we introduce to make reasoning simpler in the future.
This idea is called reification.
A typical example is when dealing with the representation of events, for which we may have varying amounts of information to describe them. 
Since predicates must have a fixed arity, we will introduce new objects to reduce n-ary predicates to 1 place predicates and functions.
