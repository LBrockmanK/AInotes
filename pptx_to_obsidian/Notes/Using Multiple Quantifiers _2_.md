Properties of quantifiers:
x y is not the same as y x
x y is not the same as y x

Why?
x y likes(x,y) “Everyone has someone they like.”
y x likes(x,y)  “There is someone who is liked by everyone.”
34

However, when the quantifiers are different then the order is VERY important.

So to express “Everyone has someone that they like” we use for all x, there exists y. which means that each x can have a different y that they like. (Or they can like the same y; there is no restriction).

However to express “There is someone who is liked by everyone”, we have to put the existential on the outside (exists x for_all y likes(x,y)) .
