We will do a quick review of First Order Logic, focusing on the language and its entailments.
FOL was invented by Frege to formalize mathematics.
Later we will consider what we might want to represent, and what inference procedures we might want to apply.

This completes our introduction KRR.
In the next lecture we will review first order logic, focusing on the syntax of the language and its truth conditions and entailments.
FOL is the basis of nearly all other KR, including those subsets that have been applied to the Semantic Web.
Before considering various restrictions and extensions  of FOL,  we will also consider how to express useful concepts in FOL and how to use reasoning o derive implicit knowledge.
