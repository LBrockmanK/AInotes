This definition captures  KR as a discipline, but doesn’t really explain KR or the underlying philosophical issues, such as  who is doing the knowing. 
To address the who question, we will use the term “agent” to refer to the entity that is doing the knowing (or doing an action of any sort).
Then we can distinguish facts that are true in the mind of some agent from those  taken to be universally true .
But  we won’t always mention this agent explicitly, for example, if all the represented knowledge corresponds to a single agent, such as “the system”.

Before we reflect on the meaning of the individual terms (knowledge, representation, and reasoning), we should
Consider one other philosophical point: normally when we think of knowledge, we assume there is some being that has the knowledge.
Whose knowledge are we talking about now?
Most of the time we will be considering some computer system that we are building, but sometimes we will consider other beings in the environment.
Here, I will use the term agent to refer to the entity that is doing the knowing (or doing an action of any sort).
Then we can distinguish facts that are true in the mind of some agent from facts that are taken to be universally true.
We will make this distinction when we define knowledge, but most of the time, the represented knowledge corresponds to a single agent, and so we can safely leave out the agent.
