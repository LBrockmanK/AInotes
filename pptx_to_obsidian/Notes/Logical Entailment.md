A set of sentences S logically entails a proposition p when the truth of p is implicit in the sentences of S
If the world is such that S is true (each proposition in S is true), then it must be case that p is also true.
Logic is the  study of entailment relations
To define a logic we define the syntax of the language (well-formedness)
The truth conditions for well-formed expressions
The rules of inference (that preserve entailment)
