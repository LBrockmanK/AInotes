Functions are used when we don’t have a symbol for an object, but we have another term that is related.
Lets say that Mike and Mary are both 22, but we don’t know that, just that
they are twins. We can define a function age that returns the age of any object.
Then age(Mike) = age(Mary) says that Mike and Mary are the same age.

Equality is also very useful when we need to count some number of objects. The idea is that to count objects we specify exactly how many of them are unique. Thus to say there are exactly two shoes, we first say there are two shoes x and y that are not the same and then say that if we talk about any shoe z it has to either be the same as x or the same as y.
