Hallmark of knowledge-based system: the ability to be told facts about the world and adjust our behavior correspondingly
for example: read a book about canaries or rare coins
Cognitive penetrability: ability of our  actions to depend on our explicit beliefs.
These are conditioned responses, e.g. 
Normally, we leave the room if we hear a fire alarm
However, we do not leave the room if we hear  a fire alarm and we believe that it is being tested.
Counter example: blinking is not cognitively penetrable


A key feature of a KBS will be the ability to tell it facts and have it adjust its behavior accordingly

Philosophers call this cognitive penetrability --- which is simply the dependence of actions on explicit beliefs that we can introspect about.
Such actions are the ones we learn to do, rather than do because of some reflex. 
Learning also means that the actions may differ depending on the conditions. So, for example,
We might normally leave the room if we hear a fire alarm. But, we might not leave the room if we hear the alarm
And we believe the alarm is being tested.
By explicitly representing knowledge, we can:
reuse knowledge to solve different tasks.
Returning a list of all white things, or painting pictures
extend existing behavior by adding new knowledge.
E.g. Canaries are yellow.
debug faulty behavior by locating erroneous beliefs.
E..g. “No the sky is not yellow. It is blue.”
explain and justify behavior of the system
E.g. “because grass is a form of vegetation

Explicit representations of knowledge give KR system many advantages over traditional procedural programs.

First, the knowledge is reusable. The same facts could be used to solve several different tasks.
Second, the knowledge is extendable. We can add new facts and the behavior will adapt immediately.
Third, we can look at the encoded facts and use them to debug faulty behavior.
Fourth, we can use the facts to explain and justify the behavior of the system.  
This is especially important for medical applications.
