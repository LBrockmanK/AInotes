Hallmark of knowledge-based system: the ability to be told facts about the world and adjust our behavior correspondingly
for example: read a book about canaries or rare coins
Cognitive penetrability: ability of our  actions to depend on our explicit beliefs.
These are conditioned responses, e.g. 
Normally, we leave the room if we hear a fire alarm
However, we do not leave the room if we hear  a fire alarm and we believe that it is being tested.
Counter example: blinking is not cognitively penetrable
