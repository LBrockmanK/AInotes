Generalized Modus Ponens (GMP)Combines AI, UE, and MP into a single ruleSUBST(,q)(where SUBST(pi') = SUBST(pi) for all i)SUBST (p) means apply substitutions in  to sentence p
Substitution list Ө = {v1/t1, v2/t2, …, vn/tn} means
Replace all occurrences of variable vi with term ti
Substitutions are made in left to right order
Formally Generalized modus ponens packages together in one step the introduction of conjunctions, the removal of the universal quantifiers and the application of the inference rule where we replace all the corresponding variables from the knowledge base so that they match.
