Logical symbols:
Punctuation: (, )
Variables:	x, y, x1…
Connectives:Ù Ú Ø Þ Û = " $
Non-Logical Symbols
Functions:	Income, Address, Sqrt, …
Constants:	Marvin, 2, Milwaukee, …
Predicates:	Teacher, Sisters, Even, Prime…

*
That completes our overview of the language of first order logic, including both the logical and the non-logical symbols.

As we look ahead to inference we may choose to exclude some of these to make reasoning more efficient.  In particular, functions (which make the domain infinite) and equality (which can add a large number of irrelevant relations) are often excluded.

Term: Constant, variable, or function… denotes an object in the world (a ground term has no variables)
Formulas
Atomic Sentence: Smallest expression with a truth value
e.g. Predicate(term1, …, termn), term1 = term2 
Sentence: An atom, quantified sentence with variables, or complex sentence using connectives; assigned a truth value
Well-Formed Formula (wff): A sentence where all variables are quantified
39

We also defined the legal expressions of the language including the terms and the well-formed formulas.

Note that a sentence that has a variable that is not bound by a quantifier (known as a free variable) is not well-formed and would not have a truth assignment.
