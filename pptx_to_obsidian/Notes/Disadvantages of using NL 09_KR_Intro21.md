Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw the man on the hill with the telescope"

First, NL is notoriously amibiguious.
The words are ambiguous, so bat can be a baseball thing or a furry flying mammal thing.
Also the grammars are ambiguous, leading to sentences that cannot be interpreted without more information.
This example is pretty well known in linguistics because of all the ways we might group the prepositional phrases.

Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope“

This is probably the intended reading. But why?
Something to do with telescopes being used for seeing clearly.
Something about there being potentially many men and needing to pick one out.
Something about there not being very many hills with telescopes known to be on them 
   --- especially hills with telescopes that don’t have their own name

"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope"
Context dependency
"John met Sam.  He gave him a shove."

A second big flaw from a reasoning point of view is the context dependency of NL.
For people this is good, because we can use fewer words to express things. 
But who are the referents for these pronouns?
Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope"
Context dependency
"John met Sam.  HeJohn gave himSam a shove."

Really, either reading would work. 
But without actually seeing the assault, or knowing anything about their tendencies to violence,  
we might assume that He refers to John and Him refers to Sam, 
because it uses the same subject and object as the previous sentence.

(Apparent) non-compositionality
"John kissed Mary." vs "John kissed [all the girls].“
Kiss(John, Mary) vs  x Forall x. girl(x) →  kiss(john,x)

The third fatal flaw for automated reasoning would be that NL appears to be non-compositional
What this means is that similar sentences might have very different representations and it wasn’t clear to logicians how to relate the two.
While this is a complaint, this non-compositionality can be addressed if one uses another construct from 
Mathematics, called the lambda calculus.
