The vocabulary will define the domain-dependent predicates and functions.
We can name individual people, places, etc.
Such as: John, Jane, Milwaukee, Aurora
We will also be able to define for them:
Basic types: e.g. Person, Man, Place, Company
Attributes: e.g. Rich, Beautiful, etc
Relationships: Married, LivesIn, WorksFor, etc
Functions: WifeOf,  FounderOf, etc

The nonlogical symbols are those that we define.
We can name things like people and places, such as John, Jane, or Milwaukee
We can also define the types of people or relations among them.
Abstract individuals are entities that we introduce to make reasoning simpler in the future.
This idea is called reification.
A typical example is when dealing with the representation of events, for which we may have varying amounts of information to describe them. 
Since predicates must have a fixed arity, we will introduce new objects to reduce n-ary predicates to 1 place predicates and functions.

The first issue, related to arity is addressed by something called abstract individuals.

Abstract individuals are those that are not present in the original problem (that is not your typical person, place, or thing) but instead are added to address problems in reasoning.

The idea of making up new individuals is called reification. Things we typically make up are events and moments or durations of time.

When we reify something we usually reduce an n-ary predicate with single place predicates and functions.
