Substitution  is said to unify p and q if SUBST(,p) = SUBST(,q)

The process of matching clauses that contain variables and constants is called unification. The substitution is called the unifier. By convention we use the symbol theta to refer to it.

In these examples,  assume all variables universally quantified.
If we have two clauses that use the same variable we must first “standardize them apart” which means picking a new variable for one of them.

Lets consider the examples in the table
