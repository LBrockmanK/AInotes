This definition captures  KR as a discipline, but doesn’t really explain KR or the underlying philosophical issues, such as  who is doing the knowing. 
To address the who question, we will use the term “agent” to refer to the entity that is doing the knowing (or doing an action of any sort).
Then we can distinguish facts that are true in the mind of some agent from those  taken to be universally true .
But  we won’t always mention this agent explicitly, for example, if all the represented knowledge corresponds to a single agent, such as “the system”.
