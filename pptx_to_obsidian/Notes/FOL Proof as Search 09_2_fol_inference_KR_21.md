Problem: huge branching factor (especially for UE)
Idea: Find a substitution that makes the rule premise match known facts
Make new, powerful inference rule!

One problem with treating FOL proof as search is the branching factor (especially if we have to consider all possible instantiations of the variables (for UE)

We really only care about one possible substitution the one that makes modus ponens possible.

One way to reduce the search space would be to combine these AI, UE, and MP into one “macro” step
