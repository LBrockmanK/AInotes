There are two types of expressions in FOL:
Terms (people, places, things)
Formulas (propositions)

Now that we have defined the symbols (the vocabulary) for FOL,  we can consider the expressions.

There are two types of expressions.

There are  terms, which are like the nouns, in that they are symbols we will use to refer to entities in the world. 

There are also formulas, which will be used to express  propositions. A proposition is a statement that will have a truth value after all of the symbols have been given an interpretation.

In the next few slides we will consider each of these two types of expressions.
