The atomic sentence predicate(term1, …, termn) is true iff the objects referred to by term1, …, termn are in the relation referred to by the predicate
What is the truth value for holding(J,cash1)?
Domain: 
Objects: R, J, sword1, cash1, …
Relation: holding is {<R,sword1>,<J,cash1>}
Since <J,cash1> is in the holding relation, holding(J,cash1) is true.

To determine the truth of any atomic sentence we look to see if the objects referred to by the terms of the sentences are in the relation referred to be the predicate of the sentence.

So we can ask about the truth value of “holding(J, cash1)”.

Since <J, cash1> is in the holding relation the sentence is true.

A sentence is valid if it is true in all models:
P1 P1	 	P1P1 	(tautologies)

A sentence is satisfiable if it is true in some models, or interpretations:
P1 P2

A sentence is unsatisfiable if it is true in no models:
P1 P1		(inconsistent/contradiction)

Some sentences are always true, no matter what truth assignment we consider for the sentences. We call these valid sentences.  P or not P is an example.

Some sentences are sometimes true. We call these satisfiable.

Some sentences are never true. We call these unsatisfiable. We can also call them inconsistent or contradictory.
