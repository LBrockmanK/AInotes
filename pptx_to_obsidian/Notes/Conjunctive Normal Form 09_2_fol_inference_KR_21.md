The KB needs to be a conjunction of CNF clauses and/or literals

CNF clause: disjunction of literals
e.g. hot(x)warm(x)cold(x)
Literal: atom (may be negated)
e.g.happy(Sally)

Any FOL KB can be converted into CNF

To apply resolution, the KB does not need to be horn, but it DOES need to be in conjunctive normal form.

A CNF clause is a disjunction of literals, where a literal is an atom or its negation.

Any FOL can be converted to CNF.
