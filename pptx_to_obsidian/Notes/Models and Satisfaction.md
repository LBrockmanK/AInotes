An interpretation will assign to each formula a truth value (true or false) according to the interpretation mapping, and the semantics of the connectives (including the quantifiers)
When a formula receives the value true by the interpretation, we say that it is satisfied.
For a set of sentences S, we say than an interpretation satisfies S if all of the sentences in S are true in the interpretation.
In this case, we say that the interpretation is a logical model of S.

An interpretation will assign each formula a truth value.

When a formula receives the value true we say that it is satisfied.

For a set of sentences we only say that an interpretation satisfies the set if it satisfies all the members of the set.\
When an interpretation satisfies a set  we say that it is a logical model of the set.
A sentence is valid if it is true in all models:
P1 P1	 	P1P1 	(tautologies)

A sentence is satisfiable if it is true in some models, or interpretations:
P1 P2

A sentence is unsatisfiable if it is true in no models:
P1 P1		(inconsistent/contradiction)

*
Some sentences are always true, no matter what truth assignment we consider for the sentences. We call these valid sentences.  P or not P is an example.

Some sentences are sometimes true. We call these satisfiable.

Some sentences are never true. We call these unsatisfiable. We can also call them inconsistent or contradictory.
