Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw the man on the hill with the telescope"


First, NL is notoriously amibiguious.
The words are ambiguous, so bat can be a baseball thing or a furry flying mammal thing.
Also the grammars are ambiguous, leading to sentences that cannot be interpreted without more information.
This example is pretty well known in linguistics because of all the ways we might group the prepositional phrases.

Syntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope“

This is probably the intended reading. But why?
Something to do with telescopes being used for seeing clearly.
Something about there being potentially many men and needing to pick one out.
Something about there not being very many hills with telescopes known to be on them 
   --- especially hills with telescopes that don’t have their own name
