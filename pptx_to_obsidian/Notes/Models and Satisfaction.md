An interpretation will assign to each formula a truth value (true or false) according to the interpretation mapping, and the semantics of the connectives (including the quantifiers)
When a formula receives the value true by the interpretation, we say that it is satisfied.
For a set of sentences S, we say than an interpretation satisfies S if all of the sentences in S are true in the interpretation.
In this case, we say that the interpretation is a logical model of S.

An interpretation will assign each formula a truth value.

When a formula receives the value true we say that it is satisfied.

For a set of sentences we only say that an interpretation satisfies the set if it satisfies all the members of the set.\
When an interpretation satisfies a set  we say that it is a logical model of the set.
