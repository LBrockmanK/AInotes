Given the domain and an interpretation mapping for all symbols,we can get the denotation of each ground term in FOL compositionally:
		Suppose   |bestFriend| = f, |Max| = max1
                  Then |bestFriend(Max)| = f(max1)
   
To interpret terms with variables, we will also need to have a variable assignment, which is a mapping from the variables to the elements in the domain.
