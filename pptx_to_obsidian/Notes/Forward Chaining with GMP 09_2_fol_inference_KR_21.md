This slide illustrates a forward chaining proof, where we only use GMP.
The facts along the top are sentences 6, 4, 3 and 2 respectively

The result of applying GMP to these sentences is shown in the second row.

The third row, shows that we can prove West is a criminal by applying GMP to the results given in the second row.  The trick is deciding how to apply generalized modus ponens to get the goal we want.
So, that is why it is often easier to work backwards.
