Beliefs thus require us to distinguish the believer as an agent.
Knowledge  is when the beliefs of an agent are really true.
“John knows it is raining”.  is the same as
  “John believes it is raining, and it is in fact raining”.
Thus to express knowledge, we  need a way of describing when something is really true and also some means of finding out that it is really true, e.g.  mapping propositions to the values true or false.

The key idea we will keep in mind is that of the agent who is having the mental attitude toward something.
Knowledge is like belief, except that there is an implied reference to the world outside the agent.
Thus, we sometimes say that knowledge is true belief.

To capture this distinction completely we might need different models, each with their own mapping to truth values (called an interpretation).
Representation is a relationship between two domains, where the first is meant to stand for the second.
The represented domain  is something “real”, e.g. the environment, of which an agent will have only limited access, such as through its sensors.
The representor domain  uses symbols, which are more accessible than the represented domain
Numerals  represent  numbers
Names   represent objects
Sentences  represent  propositions
The mapping from the representor to the represented is the semantics of the representation

Okay, so now we can consider the second question, what is representation.
**
Representation is a link between two domains, such that the first is meant to stand for the second.
**
Since we might have multiple layers of representation, lets keep it simple and think of the second one, the represented domain, as the real world.
The real world is not entirely accessible to an agent, who is limited to the percepts that he receives from his sensors.
In people that would be eyes, ears, nose, etc.
In computers it would might be only the ability to read characters from a file or keyboard buffer.
**
The representor domain then uses symbols, each corresponding to the objects in its domain that it has access to.
For example, it uses numerals to represent numbers or quantities. 
It uses names to represent objects
It uses sentences in some language to represent propositions.
**
The mapping from representor to represented corresponds to the semantics of the representation.
Whem the mapping is part of the real world, to access the semantics in a machine, we would need to represent this mapping, that we willl call the interpretation.
