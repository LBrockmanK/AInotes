In the examples that we have seen, every variable that we have seen has been bound by a quantifier. This is required.

A so-called free variable is one that is not bound by a quantifier. But if a variable is free, then we have no way to determine the meaning of the sentence.

A well-formed formula (WFF, or “woof”) is a sentence where all the variables are quantified.
