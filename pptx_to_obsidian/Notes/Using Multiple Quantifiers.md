These next few slides contain several interesting properties of quantifiers and their orderings.  I will mention these things briefly, but you should take a minute before moving on.

First, when you have two nested quantifiers that are the same, it doesn’t matter what order they come in. (It is like you are picking two elements from a set but immediately putting the first element back before you pick the second one, so there is no dependence between the two.)

In English this is like saying “Everyone likes everybody” is the same as “Everyone is liked by everybody”.
