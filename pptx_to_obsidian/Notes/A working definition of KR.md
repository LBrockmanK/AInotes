Knowledge representation and reasoning is an area of AI that is concerned with how to use symbols to represent "a domain of discourse", along with functions that allow inference about the objects within the domain of discourse to occur. 
Adapted from the Wikipedia Article on KRR

A domain of discourse constitutes the entities in  a problem under consideration, including the objects,  their properties and capabilities, and any known facts about entities, events or states of the environment.
Inference is a procedure by which we can determine the truth of facts we have not been told explicitly (ie the implicitly known ones).
