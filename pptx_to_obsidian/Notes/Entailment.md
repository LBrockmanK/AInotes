If S is a set of sentences, and p is any sentence, we say that p is a logical consequence of S, or that  S logically entails p, if and only if for every interpretation that satisfies S then the interpretation also satisfies p.
In other words, S entails p iff every model of S satisfies p.
S |= p
Note, that when p is valid, S can be empty.

Here is another piece of terminology - entailment.

S entails p if and only if every model of S satisfiers p.
