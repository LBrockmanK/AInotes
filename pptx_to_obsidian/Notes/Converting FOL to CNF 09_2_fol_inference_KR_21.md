The next step is to replace existential quantifiers with unique constants. We call this process skolemization.

Once all the quantifiers are universal, we can drop them all.

The final steps are to create conjunctions of disjunctions (we do this by distributing V over ^

Then we group conjunctions and disjunctions together.

Here is an example.
