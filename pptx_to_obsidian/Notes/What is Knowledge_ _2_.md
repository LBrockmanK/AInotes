Beliefs thus require us to distinguish the believer as an agent.
Knowledge  is when the beliefs of an agent are really true.
“John knows it is raining”.  is the same as
  “John believes it is raining, and it is in fact raining”.
Thus to express knowledge, we  need a way of describing when something is really true and also some means of finding out that it is really true, e.g.  mapping propositions to the values true or false.
