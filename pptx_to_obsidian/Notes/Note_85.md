Disadvantage of using NLSyntactic ambiguity
"I saw [the man on the hill] with the telescope"
Context dependency
"John met Sam.  HeJohn gave himSam a shove."

Really, either reading would work. 
But without actually seeing the assault, or knowing anything about their tendencies to violence,  
we might assume that He refers to John and Him refers to Sam, 
because it uses the same subject and object as the previous sentence.
