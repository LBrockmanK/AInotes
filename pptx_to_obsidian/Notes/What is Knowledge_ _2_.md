Beliefs thus require us to distinguish the believer as an agent.
Knowledge  is when the beliefs of an agent are really true.
“John knows it is raining”.  is the same as
  “John believes it is raining, and it is in fact raining”.
Thus to express knowledge, we  need a way of describing when something is really true and also some means of finding out that it is really true, e.g.  mapping propositions to the values true or false.

The key idea we will keep in mind is that of the agent who is having the mental attitude toward something.
Knowledge is like belief, except that there is an implied reference to the world outside the agent.
Thus, we sometimes say that knowledge is true belief.

To capture this distinction completely we might need different models, each with their own mapping to truth values (called an interpretation).
