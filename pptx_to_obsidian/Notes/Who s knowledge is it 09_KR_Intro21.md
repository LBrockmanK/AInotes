This definition captures  KR as a discipline, but doesn’t really explain KR or the underlying philosophical issues, such as  who is doing the knowing. 
To address the who question, we will use the term “agent” to refer to the entity that is doing the knowing (or doing an action of any sort).
Then we can distinguish facts that are true in the mind of some agent from those  taken to be universally true .
But  we won’t always mention this agent explicitly, for example, if all the represented knowledge corresponds to a single agent, such as “the system”.

Before we reflect on the meaning of the individual terms (knowledge, representation, and reasoning), we should
Consider one other philosophical point: normally when we think of knowledge, we assume there is some being that has the knowledge.
Whose knowledge are we talking about now?
Most of the time we will be considering some computer system that we are building, but sometimes we will consider other beings in the environment.
Here, I will use the term agent to refer to the entity that is doing the knowing (or doing an action of any sort).
Then we can distinguish facts that are true in the mind of some agent from facts that are taken to be universally true.
We will make this distinction when we define knowledge, but most of the time, the represented knowledge corresponds to a single agent, and so we can safely leave out the agent.
There are many formalisms for KR, nearly all based on some logic, because logics are very expressive and the semantics and reasoning systems for them are well-defined 
Approaches will vary significantly in how easy it is to say things and how long it takes, in real-time, to make the inferences that are needed by an application.
More expressive languages tend to allow us to say things more compactly, but reasoning with them take much longer.. 

The key problem is to thus to  find a KR approach that can make the inferences an application needs in time that is within the resource constraints of the problem at hand

When we talk about symbols, most of the time we will be talking about them as part of a logic.
Logics are expressive, have well-defined semantics, and support reasoning.
There are several variations of logic because in its full-expressiveness, logic is undecidable.
Different logics make it easier or harder to say things, and make it easier or harder to do automated reasoning.
Part of what you want to learn is how to select a logic and reasoner that is just powerful enough to do what is needed in time that meets the resource constraints of the problem
