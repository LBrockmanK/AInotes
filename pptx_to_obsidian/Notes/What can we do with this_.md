Once we have a KB of facts, when we can use it to answer questions. 
A proof is simply a sequence of FOL sentences that proceeds from what is known to be true until a suitable conclusion is reached.
We will address this together, when we consider inference in FOL.

What do we do with all these facts?  Well a KB is not very useful on its own.  We will rely on some sort of reasoning procedure to allow us to answer questions that are not explicit in the representation.

A proof is just that: it is a sequence of logical sentences that proceeds from what is known to be true until a suitable conclusion is reached. The solution will tell us whether something is true, and it can also tell us for which individual the answer would be true.

In the meantime, we will consider two issues not addressed so far: what to do when it seems like a predicate does not have a fixed arity and what we can do in FOL to describe measurable quantities.
Abstract individuals are entities that we introduce to make reasoning simpler in the future.
This idea is called reification.
A typical example is when dealing with the representation of events, for which we may have varying amounts of information to describe them. 
Since predicates must have a fixed arity, we will introduce new objects to reduce n-ary predicates to 1 place predicates and functions.

The first issue, related to arity is addressed by something called abstract individuals.

Abstract individuals are those that are not present in the original problem (that is not your typical person, place, or thing) but instead are added to address problems in reasoning.

The idea of making up new individuals is called reification. Things we typically make up are events and moments or durations of time.

When we reify something we usually reduce an n-ary predicate with single place predicates and functions.
