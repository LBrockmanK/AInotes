Generalized Modus Ponens (GMP)Unify rule premises with known facts and apply unifier to conclusion

Rule:  x,y turtle(x)  rabbit(y)  outlasts(x,y)
Known facts:	turtle(Thom), and rabbit(Rob)
Unifier:	{x/Thom, y/Rob}

Apply unifier to conclusion: outlasts(Thom,Rob)
We call this new rule generalized modus ponens.

In the proof we have been considering, we would unify X with Thom and  Y with Rob and consider no other substitutions.

We would then apply this unifier to the conclusion of the implication.
