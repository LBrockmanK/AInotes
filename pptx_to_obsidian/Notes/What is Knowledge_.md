Consider the relationships between a knower and a proposition that we can express in language:
John knows it is raining.
John hopes it is raining.
John thinks it may be raining.
These relationships are called propositional attitudes, and are usually indicated by the verb when the agent is mentioned explicitly.
Beliefs correspond to a judgment by an agent about the state of the world.
John believes it is raining

First, what do we mean by knowledge.
Knowledge is a mental state, one of many, that holds of an agent and some statement (called a proposition).

Knowing, hoping, thinking, remembering: these are all examples of mental states. Our language is rich with them.
Formally, we call the relationships “propositional attitudes” and they appear as verbs in our language.
One special case is believing. Believing seems to express a judgment of an agent about the truth of some statement.
Belief is also somewhat special, because we assume that the agent is aware of his belief, that is that he would
Believe that he believes it is raining, and so on. For now we will keep it simple though.
